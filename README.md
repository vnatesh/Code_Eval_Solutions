# Code_Eval_Solutions
This is a repository containing python solutions to selected easy, moderate, and hard code-eval problems. Please do not copy these solutions or claim them as your own. They are meant to be an online storage of code for myself, an educational source for people trying to learn, and a tool for potential employers to evaluate my coding ability.

There are three directories in this respository, representing easy, moderate, and hard problems. Each solution document contains the problem statement as well as test inputs and outputs that can be used to verify the accuracy of the code. However, if you wish to verify the solutions, you will have to create your own .txt file with test cases on your computer. I did not include test cases in a separate file as the directory would become too clutered. 

The purpose of this project is to solve as many problems as possible. For this reason, I am still in the process of finishing the problem list and will update this repository accordingly. Each piece of code runs within the allotted 10 seconds by code-eval and is also memory efficent to the code-eval specifications.
